			<h1>Handcrafted video games delivered straight to your device.</h1>
			<p>The Brooklyn Gamery was founded in 2013 by Catt Small, Chris Algoo, Dennis Liaw, and Xer Gata. We make high-quality games for different devices and operating systems -- including new, experimental technology. We incorporate Agile and Lean Startup methodologies into our game-making process to create polished games in less time with less overhead.</p>

			<p>When we make a game, it's made with the love of four multitalented game-makers. No matter the genre, each game we create will be tested and iterated upon multiple times to ensure that it is both beautiful and entertaining. That's why the Brooklyn Gamery's motto is "handcrafted video games delivered straight to your device".</p>
