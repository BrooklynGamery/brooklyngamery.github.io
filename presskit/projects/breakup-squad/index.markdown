## History

Breakup Squad was originally created by Catt Small for NYU Game Centerâ€™s 2016 No Quarter Exhibition. Chris Algoo signed on to help with development, but Dennis Liaw was unable to assist due to outside obligations. An initial version of the game was launched on Itch.io on October 30, 2016.

Since launch, the game has been shown at other exhibitions since No Quarter such as JUEGOS RANCHEROS in Austin, That Party during GDC 2017, as well as at the V&A Museum in London. A new level was added to the game in March 2017 to commemorate the That Party exhibition.
