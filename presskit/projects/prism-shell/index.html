Dodge alien attacks, shift into better firing positions, and collect currency for upgrades. You are Earth’s last chance for survival. Can you and Major Beretta pilot the Prism Shell to victory?</p>

<section id="history">
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The first version of Prism Shell was created for a 2013 Tizen Devlab and Hack event in New York. The goal of the game was to create a fun, intuitive space shooter game without onscreen controls. The game had such great gameplay and polish that the judges were surprised it was actually made in 24 hours.</p>

	<p>After winning the event’s runner-up prize, the team continued to work on Prism Shell with the intention of releasing it for Tizen, a new mobile operating system. The game grew into a much larger project with planned in-app purchases and multiple tanks.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, Tizen’s release date was pushed back, so the team decided to release Prism Shell on Android and iOS instead.  In order to ship the game faster, the team decided to scale the game back down to its core differentiators.</p>
